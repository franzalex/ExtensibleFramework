The extensible framework application scans all directories for files whose names
match the expression *.info.txt. 

Each line of this INFO.TXT file should contain the  file name of a plugin 
relative to the parent directory of the INFO.TXT file.

An easy way of doing this is to create the text file manually in the build 
output folder. However, a more robust way of achieving the same purpose is by
utilising build events.

In the Build Events dialog (Project Properties > Compile > Build Events), enter 
the following in the Post-build event command line text box

    CMD.EXE /C ECHO "$(TargetFileName)" > "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).info.txt"

This will create an INFO.TXT file with the same name as your output file in the
build output directory. the INFO.TXT file will also be automatically populated
with the file name of the build output (the DLL file containing the plugin).
